%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
\documentclass[3p,times,twocolumn]{elsarticle}

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}
\usepackage{lipsum}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Software Development for Engineering Research}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{SDER}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
In recent years, numerous research studies have identified a compelling case for desiging and distributing cleaner burning biomass cookstoves for low resource communities. Household air pollution, as a product of poor combustion efficiency of existing cooking technology, can cause chronic respiratory conditionsand has been linked to nearly four million premature deaths annually [REFERNCE THE CLEAN COOKING ALLIANCE PAGE--OPEN IN BROWSER]. Additionally, using biomass as a fuel source for existing inefficient cooking technology contributes significantly to global black carbon emission, which (LC PUT SOMETHING JUICY HERE FROM BOND REPORT). Identification of the pervasive lack of clean cooking technology has led to numerous investigations regarding the improvement of existing cooking technology.

Research studies in the recent past have investigated the state of clean cooking development from social, economic, and technological perspectives. BLURB ABOUT STATE OF SOCIAL. BLURB ABOUT STATE OF ECONOMICS. Within the clean cookstove industry, technical investigations focus primarily on understanding how to improve biomass combustion products and thermal efficiencies of cookstove technology.Research groups around the globe have contributed to the library of engineering evaluations of existing cookstoves by sharing model details and results of computational simulations. Many existing computational models, however, draw physical conclusions based on individual cookstove configurations leaving a vacancy in understanding for numerous different cookstove designs. The impact of producing a computational model of a biomass cookstove could be greatly improved by allowing designers to simulate a variety of cookstove configurations by way of a user-friendly open source software package.   Many (ALL MAYBE?) existing 

The intent of this paper is, first, to provide a review of existing computational modelling and software development efforts within the cookstove industry. Additionally, the paper presents version 1 (LC COME BACK HERE-is it v 1?) of the StoveOpt (LC MAKE SURE CITATIONS ARE SOLID WHEN REFERRING TO OWN SOFTWARE) software package; an open source biomass cookstove computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator with built in optimimzation functionality. Specifically, the paper will discuss on the methodoly used in the CFD simulations and the implementation of the software (design, layout, functionality, etc.). The paper will share results from a preliminary case, draw conclusions about the package, and establish future work.
